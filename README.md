philobits.academy
philo.academy
philosophia.academy
philosophia.community
digiphilo.com
nous.ac
fortheloveofsophia.ac
whosaidwhat.ac

2. What type or genre of domain is this? (Ex. Game, Toy, Greeting Card Generator, Creative Tool, Political Pamphlet, Archive)
Academic (pertaining to Philosophy) / Archive

3. Write a small story (one paragraph or so) that details a user's experience of discovering your domain, visiting it within a particular context (like mobile, desktop, while hungry, at a funeral, etc.), experiencing what it has to offer, and subsequently leaving.
The ideal user for this domain is someone who is curious and interested in the study of Philosophy. They are probably not an “expert” in Philosophy, but they value engaging in philosophical conversations, or even just reflecting certain concepts on their own. This user appreciates thoughtful ideas, the creative process and exceptional design. A user might be sipping their morning tea or coffee at home, and visiting the domain on their computer or tablet as a part of their daily routine. They might tab / save a few pages that are interesting to them, or relate to their creative work in one way or another, so that they can read into them further, as the day progresses. The user is then on the subway, with a substantial commute to work ahead of them. They will pull out their tablet or iPhone and revisit the saved passages (are able to access this offline). The user can then read further into these ideas, perhaps reading the chapter it came from, with a short summary of the context of the passage. If they find that the particular topic was in fact of interest to them, or useful in their work, they can archive the page.
  
4. Would somebody return to your domain after visiting it for the first time - in how long do you think - and why?
Yes, a user would definitely return to this domain after visiting it for the first time. Some users might visit daily, while others might come back every now and then for inspiration.

5. List some 'stuff' that your site 'does'. (Be detailed)
tabs quotes / passages
archives favorite quotes
recommends based on what you’ve liked in the past
maybe even allows the user to input their ideas / thoughts / reactions
changes on a daily basis
e-mails you quotes / passages
allows you to share quotes / passages
